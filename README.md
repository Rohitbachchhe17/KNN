# KNN
# k-nearest neighbor algorithm in Python
Supervised Learning : 
It is the learning where the value or result that we want to predict is within the training data (labeled data) and the value which is in data that we want to study is known as Target or Dependent Variable or Response Variable.

 All the other columns in the dataset are known as the Feature or Predictor Variable or Independent Variable.

# Supervised Learning is classified into two categories:

1) Classification: Here our target variable consists of the categories.
2) Regression: Here our target variable is continuous and we usually try to find out the line of the curve.

# k-nearest neighbor algorithm:
This algorithm is used to solve the classification model problems. K-nearest neighbor or K-NN algorithm basically creates an imaginary boundary to classify the data. When new data points come in, the algorithm will try to predict that to the nearest of the boundary line.

Therefore, larger k value means smother curves of separation resulting in less complex models. Whereas, smaller k value tends to overfit the data and resulting in complex models.
